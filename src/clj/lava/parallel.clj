(comment "
The parallel library wraps the ForkJoin library scheduled for inclusion in JDK 7:

http://gee.cs.oswego.edu/dl/concurrency-interest/index.html

You'll need jsr166y.jar in your classpath in order to use this
library.  The basic idea is that Lava collections, and most
efficiently vectors, can be turned into parallel arrays for use by
this library with the function par, although most of the functions
take collections and will call par if needed, so normally you will
only need to call par explicitly in order to attach bound/filter/map
ops. Parallel arrays support the attachment of bounds, filters and
mapping functions prior to realization/calculation, which happens as
the result of any of several operations on the
array (pvec/psort/pfilter-nils/pfilter-dupes). Rather than perform
composite operations in steps, as would normally be done with
sequences, maps and filters are instead attached and thus composed by
providing ops to par. Note that there is an order sensitivity to the
attachments - bounds precede filters precede mappings.  All operations
then happen in parallel, using multiple threads and a sophisticated
work-stealing system supported by fork-join, either when the array is
realized, or to perform aggregate operations like preduce/pmin/pmax
etc. A parallel array can be realized into a Lava vector using
pvec.

  "Creates a parallel array from coll. ops, if supplied, perform
  on-the-fly filtering or transformations during parallel realization
  or calculation. ops form a chain, and bounds must precede filters,
  must precede maps. ops must be a set of keyword value pairs of the
  following forms:

     :bound [start end] 

  Only elements from start (inclusive) to end (exclusive) will be
  processed when the array is realized.

     :filter pred 

  Filter preds remove elements from processing when the array is realized. pred
  must be a function of one argument whose return will be processed
  via boolean.

     :filter-index pred2 

  pred2 must be a function of two arguments, which will be an element
  of the collection and the corresponding index, whose return will be
  processed via boolean.

     :filter-with [pred2 coll2] 

  pred2 must be a function of two arguments, which will be
  corresponding elements of the 2 collections.

     :map f 

  Map fns will be used to transform elements when the array is
  realized. f must be a function of one argument.

     :map-index f2 

  f2 must be a function of two arguments, which will be an element of
  the collection and the corresponding index.

     :map-with [f2 coll2]

  f2 must be a function of two arguments, which will be corresponding
  elements of the 2 collections."
