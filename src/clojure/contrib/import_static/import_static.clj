(defmacro import-static
  "Imports the named static fields and/or static methods of the class
  as (private) symbols in the current namespace.

  Example: 
      user=> (import-static java.lang.Math PI sqrt)
      nil
      user=> PI
      3.141592653589793
      user=> (sqrt 16)

  Note: The class name must be fully qualified, even if it has already
  been imported.  Static methods are defined as MACROS, not
  first-class fns."
