;; Accumulators

;; by Konrad Hinsen
;; last updated May 19, 2009

;; This module defines various accumulators (list, vector, map,
;; sum, product, counter, and combinations thereof) with a common
;; interface defined by the multimethods add and combine.
;; For each accumulator type, its empty value is defined in this module.
;; Applications typically use this as a starting value and add data
;; using the add multimethod.
