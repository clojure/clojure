     :doc "Generic interfaces
           This library provides generic interfaces in the form of
           multimethods that can be implemented for any type.
           The interfaces partly duplicate existing non-generic
           functions in clojure.core (arithmetic, comparison,
           collections) and partly provide additional functions that
           can be defined for a wide variety of types (functors, math
           functions). More functions will be added in the future."}

; A dispatch function that separates nulary, unary, binary, and
; higher arity calls and also selects on type for unary and binary
; calls.

(defn nary-dispatch
  ([] ::nulary)
  ([x] (type x))
  ([x y]
     [(type x) (type y)])
  ([x y & more] ::nary))

;
; We can't use [::binary :default], so we need to define a root type
; of the type hierarcy. The derivation for Object covers all classes,
; but all non-class types will need an explicit derive clause.
; Ultimately, a macro might take care of this.
