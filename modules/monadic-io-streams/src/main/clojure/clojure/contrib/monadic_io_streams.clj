     :doc "Monadic I/O with Java input/output streams
           Defines monadic I/O statements to be used in a state monad
           with an input or output stream as the state. The macro
           monadic-io creates a stream, runs a monadic I/O statement
           on it, and closes the stream. This structure permits the
           definition of purely functional compound I/O statements
           which are applied to streams that can never escape from the
           monadic statement sequence."}
