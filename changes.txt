= 6 About Alpha Releases

1.3 is the first release of Clojure that will include a series of
alpha builds. We are adding these builds to support maven and
leiningen users, who want a specific artifact that they can target (as
opposed to building from master or "moving-target" snapshots).

If you are the kind of person who used to track master by building
from source, but no longer do so because you are using maven or
leiningen, alpha releases are for you.
