= 1 Deprecated and Removed Features =

== 1.1 Earmuffed Vars Are No Longer Automatically Considered Dynamic. ==

  (def *fred*)
  => Warning: *fred* not declared dynamic and thus is not dynamically rebindable, but its name suggests otherwise. Please either indicate ^:dynamic ** or change the name.

== 1.2 ISeq No Longer Inherits from Sequential ==

This allows ISeq implementers to be in the map or set equality partition.

== 1.3 Removed Bit Operation Support for Boxed Numbers ==

Bit Operations map directly to primitive operations

== 1.4 Ancillary Namespaces No Longer Auto-Load on Startup ==

The following namespaces are no longer loaded on startup: clojure.set, clojure.xml, clojure.zip

== 1.5 Replicate Deprecated ==

Use repeat instead.

= 2 New/Improved Features =

== 2.1 Enhanced Primitive Support ==

Full details here: http://dev.clojure.org/display/doc/Enhanced+Primitive+Support and http://dev.clojure.org/display/doc/Documentation+for+1.3+Numerics

== 2.2 defrecord and deftype Improvements ==

Details here: http://dev.clojure.org/display/design/defrecord+improvements

== 2.3 Better Exception Reporting ==

Details here: http://dev.clojure.org/display/design/Error+Handling

Additionally:
Better error messages:
  * When calling macros with arity
  * For Invalid Map Literals
  * For alias function if using unknown namespace
  * In the REPL
  * Add "starting at <line>" to EOF while reading exceptions
  * Better compilation error reporting


== 2.4 clojure.reflect/reflect ==

Full details here: http://dev.clojure.org/display/design/Reflection+API

== 2.5 clojure.data/diff ==

Recursively compares a and b, returning a tuple of [things-only-in-a things-only-in-b things-in-both]

  (diff {:a 1 :b 2} {:a 1 :b 22 :c 3})
  => ({:b 2} {:c 3, :b 22} {:a 1})

== 2.6 clojure.core/every-pred and clojure.core/some-fn Combinators ==

every-pred takes a set of predicates and returns a function f that returns true if all of its composing predicates return a logical true value against all of its arguments, else it returns false.

  ((every-pred even?) 2 4 6)
  => true

  ((every-pred even?) 2 4 5)
  =>false

some-fn takes a set of predicates and returns a function f that returns the first logical true value  returned by one of its composing predicates against any of its arguments, else it returns logical false.

  ((some-fn even?) 2 4 5)
  => true
  ((some-fn odd?) 2 4 6)
  => false

== 2.7 clojure.core/realized? ==

Returns true if a value has been produced for a promise, delay, future or lazy sequence.

  (let [x (range 5)]
    (println (realized? x))
    (first x)
    (println (realized? x)))
  => false
  => true

== 2.8 clojure.core/with-redefs-fn & clojure.core/with-redefs ==

with-redefs-fn temporarily redefines Vars during a call to func. with-redefs temporarily redefines Vars while executing the body.

  (with-redefs [nil? :temp] (println nil?))
  => :temp

== 2.9 clojure.core/find-keyword ==

Returns a Keyword with the given namespace and name if one already exists.

  (find-keyword "def")
  => :def
  (find-keyword "fred")
  => nil

== 2.10 clojure.repl/pst ==

Prints a stack trace of the exception

  pst
  => (pst (IllegalArgumentException.))
    IllegalArgumentException
        user/eval27 (NO_SOURCE_FILE:18)
        clojure.lang.Compiler.eval (Compiler.java:6355)
        clojure.lang.Compiler.eval (Compiler.java:6322)
        clojure.core/eval (core.clj:2699)
        clojure.main/repl/read-eval-print--5906 (main.clj:244)
        clojure.main/repl/fn--5911 (main.clj:265)
        clojure.main/repl (main.clj:265)
        clojure.main/repl-opt (main.clj:331)
        clojure.main/main (main.clj:427)
        clojure.lang.Var.invoke (Var.java:397)
        clojure.lang.Var.applyTo (Var.java:518)
        clojure.main.main (main.java:37)

== 2.11 clojure.pprint/print-table

Prints a collection of maps in a textual table.

  (print-table [:fred :barney] [{:fred "ethel"} {:fred "wilma" :barney "betty"}])
  => ===============
     :fred | :barney
     ===============
     ethel |
     wilma | betty
     ===============

== 2.12 pprint respects *print-length* ==

Assigning *print-length* now affects output of pprint

== 2.13 compilation and deployment via Maven ==

See the following pages for more information
http://dev.clojure.org/display/doc/Maven+Settings+and+Repositories
http://dev.clojure.org/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=950842
http://dev.clojure.org/display/design/Common+Contrib+Build
http://dev.clojure.org/display/design/How+to+Make+Releases

== 2.14 internal keyword map uses weak refs ==

== 2.15 ^:const defs ==

^:const lets you name primitive values with speedier reference.

  (def constants
   {:pi 3.14
    :e 2.71})

  (def ^:const pi (:pi constants))
  (def ^:const e (:e constants))

The overhead of looking up :e and :pi in the map happens at compile time, as (:pi constants) and (:e constants) are evaluated when their parent def forms are evaluated.

== 2.16 Message Bearing Assert ==

Assert can take a second argument which will be printed when the assert fails

  (assert (= 1 2) "1 is not equal to 2")
  => AssertionError Assert failed: 1 is not equal to 2

== 2.17 Error Checking for defmulti Options ==

defmulti will check to verify that its options are valid. For example, the following code will throw an exception:

  (defmulti fred :ethel :lucy :ricky)
  => IllegalArgumentException

== 2.18 Removed Checked Exceptions ==

Clojure does not throw checked exceptions

== 2.19 vector-of Takes Multiple Args ==

vector-of takes multiple args used to populate the array

  (vector-of :int 1 2 3)
  => [1 2 3]

== 2.20 deref with timeout ==

deref now takes a timeout option - when given with a blocking reference, will return the timeout-val if the timeout (in milliseconds) is reached before value is available.

  (deref (promise) 10 :ethel)
  => :ethel

== 2.21 Walk Support for sorted-by Collections

Walk modified to work on sorted-by collections

  let [x (sorted-set-by > 1 2 3)] (walk inc reverse x))
  => (2 3 4)

== 2.22 string.join Enhanced to Work with Sets ==

Just like join works on other collections

  (join " and " #{:fred :ethel :lucy})
  => ":lucy and :fred and :ethel"

== 2.23 clojure.test-helper ==

All test helpers moved into clojure.test-helper

== 2.24 Newline outputs platform-specific newline sequence ==

Newline sequence is output as \r\n on Windows now.

== 2.25 init-proxy and update-proxy return proxy ==

Now you can chain calls on the proxy

== 2.26 doc & find-doc moved to REPL ==

Adds special form docs to the REPL

== 2.27 clojure.java.shell/sh accepts as input anything that clojure.java.io/copy does

This adds InputStream, Reader, File, byte[] to the list of inputs for clojure.java.shell/sh

== 2.28 Interrupt Handler Promoted to clojure.repl ==

Promoting this library eliminates the need for a dependency on old contrib.

== 2.29 Add support for running -main namespaces from clojure.main

This patch allows clojure.main to accept an argument pointing to a namespace to look for a -main function in. This allows users to write -main functions that will work the same whether the code is AOT-compiled for use in an executable jar or just run from source.

== 2.30 Set thread names on agent thread pools ==

It's a best practice to name the threads in an executor thread pool with a custom ThreadFactory so that the purpose of these threads is clear in thread dumps and other runtime operational tools.

Patch causes thread names like:

    clojure-agent-send-pool-%d  (should be fixed # of threads)
    clojure-agent-send-off-pool-%d (will be added and removed over time)

== 2.31 Add docstring support to def ==

defs can now have docstrings

== 2.32 Comp function returns identity when called with zero arity ==

  (= (comp) identity)
  => true

== 2.33 Type hints can be applied to arg vectors ==

You can hint different arities separately:

  (defn hinted
    (^String [])
    (^Integer [a])
    (^java.util.List [a & args]))

This is preferred over hinting the function name. Hinting the function name is still allowed for backward compatibility, but will likely be deprecated in a future release.

== 2.34 Binding Conveyance ==

Clojure APIs that pass work off to other threads (e.g. send, send-off, pmap, future) now convey the dynamic bindings of the calling thread:

  (def ^:dynamic *num* 1)
  (binding [*num* 2] (future (println *num*)))
  ;; prints "2", not "1"

= 3 Performance Enhancements =

  * Code path for using vars is now much faster for the common case
  * Improved startup time
  * Fix performance on some numeric overloads
  ** See CLJ-380 for more information
  * Promises are lock free
  * Functions only get metadata support code when metadata explicitly supplied
  * definterface/gen-interface accepts array type hints
  * inline nil?
  * inline bit-functions & math ops
  * inline n-ary min & max
  * PersistentQueue count is now O(1)
  * Intrinsics: unchecked math operators now emit bytecodes directly where possible

= 5 Modular Contrib =

In 1.3, the monolithic clojure-contrib.jar has been replaced by a modular system of contrib libraries, so that production systems can include only the code they actually need. This also allows individual contribs to have their own release cycles. Many contribs have moved forward by several point versions already. Documentation for updating applications to use the new contrib libraries is at http://dev.clojure.org/display/design/Where+Did+Clojure.Contrib+Go

Important Note: Many of the new modular contribs are compatible with both 1.2 and 1.3. This offers an incremental migration path: First, upgrade your contrib libraries while holding Clojure at 1.2, Then, in a separate step, upgrade to Clojure 1.3.
