= 0 Changes from beta1 -> RC1 -> RC2

= 0.0 Clojure 1.2 is the same code as Clojure RC3

  * only change is build metadata and changes.txt

= 0.1 Changes from RC2 to RC3

  * #382 underive fixed
  * #423 future now clears closed-over variables, allowing gc
  * #404 clojure.java.io: reader and writer work correctly for sockets
  * #422 fixed corner case in finally blocks where code could execute twice

= 0.2 Changes from RC1 to RC2

Record/map equality is now symmetric in all cases. There are two
variants:

  * In most cases, you should use =. Calls to = include type
    information, so instances of different record types can never be =
    to each other, or to plain maps.

  * Calls to .equals are different. They respect the Java semantics
    for maps, which is a requirement for correct interop. Type
    information is *not* included, so any kind of map can be .equals
    to any other.

Possible impacts for your programs:
  
  * If you create a custom implementation of Clojure's IPersistentMap,
    you probably want it to be able to be = to other maps. If so, all
    you need to do is implement the marker interface
    clojure.lang.MapEquivalence. Note that APersistentMap does this
    for you.

= 0.3 Changes from beta1 to RC1 =

  * switch to soft refs for class and keyword cache
  * update reify, defprotocol, extend-protocol docstrings (#340)
  * fix fieldless defrecord corner case (#402)
  * sh reads stdout and stderr in parallel
  * sh stdin, stdout default to UTF-8 (#413)
  * gen-class checks validity of method names (#407)
 
= 1 Deprecated and Removed Features =

== 1.1 metadata reader macro is now ^ ==

^ is the metadata reader macro. The former syntax #^ is deprecated and
will be removed in a future version of Clojure.


= 2 New Features in clojure.core =

== 2.1 Protocols, Records, Reify, and Types ==

defprotocol provides polymorphism without type intrusion.

defrecord, reify, and deftype provide datatypes. They support, in a
relatively clean manner, access to the highest-performance primitive
representation and polymorphism mechanisms of the host.

See http://clojure.org/protocols and http://clojure.org/datatypes for
a more complete description.


== 2.2 Sequence Library ==

The sequence library has several new functions in Clojure 1.2. The
notes in parentheses indicate differences from the similarly-named
functions in clojure-contrib.

  * flatten - New
  * frequencies - New
  * group-by - New        (note: unsorted)
  * keep - New
  * keep-indexed - New    (preferred over contrib's indexed for perf)
  * map-indexed - New     (preferred over contrib's indexed for perf)
  * partition-all - New
  * partition-by - New 
  * rand-nth - New        (name indicates dependency on nth's perf)
  * range - Improved      (added zero arity)
  * reductions - New
  * repeatedly - Improved! (added "do n times" semantics)
  * shuffle - New


== 2.3 Destructuring Enhanced ==

If you associatively destructure a seq, it will be poured into a map first:

  (defn foo [& {:keys [a b c]}]
    [a b c])

  (foo :c 3 :b 2)
  => [nil 2 3]


== 2.4 Case ==

Case provides constant time dispatch on its clauses, which can be any
compile-time literal

  (defn release-status
    [version]
    (case version
     (0.9 1.0 1.1) "History"
     1.2           "Right now"
     :sentient     "RSN"
     "The default"))

The string "The default" represents the default clause and can be any
expression, not only a compile-time literal.


== 2.5 Duplicate Key Prevention ==

Associative literals and their constructor functions hash-map and
hash-set now prevent duplicate keys:

  #{1 1}
  => java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Duplicate key: 1


== 2.6 Primitive Vectors ==

vector-of creates a vector of unboxed Java primitives, which follows
the contract of Clojure vectors.  It takes one keyword argument
corresponding to its primitive type that can be any of :int, :long,
:float, :double, :byte, :short, :boolean, or :char.


== 2.7 Agent Error Handling ==

Agent error handling has been reworked in Clojure 1.2.

  * agent-error - New
  * restart-agent - New
  * set-error-handler - New
  * error-handler - New
  * set-error-mode! - New
  * error-mode - New
  * await - improved docstring, explains failed agent semantics
  * agent-errors - DEPRECATED
  * clear-agent-errors - DEPRECATED


== 2.8 Improved Ratio Support ==

  * numerator - New
  * denominator - New
  * bigint - Enhanced, now ratio aware


== 2.9 Macro Implicit Args ==

Macros now have access to implicit arguments:
 
  * &form - the macro form
  * &env  - the local bindings


== 2.10 Multimethod Enhancements ==

Multimethods have been enhanced to improve interactive development:
 
  * remove-all-methods - New
  * defmulti - Enhanced to have defonce semantics


== 2.11 Function Metadata ==

Clojure functions can now have metadata. Please treat this capability
as alpha and subject to possible change or removal in a future version
of Clojure.


== 2.12 Java Annotations ==

Java Annotations can be added simply by making a Java annotation
class a key in a Clojure metadata map:

  ;; Name is deprecated
  (defrecord ^{Deprecated true} Name [first last])

Please use Java annotations for interop purposes only. 

== 2.13 Namespace Collision Warnings ==

If a namespace defines a Var whose name collides with a name in the
clojure.core namespace, you will see a warning but the definition will
be allowed to proceed. This facilitates promoting useful functions
into clojure.core without causing a breaking change.

Please track down and fix these warnings, as matching names do not
always imply matching semantics!


= 3 New Namespaces =

Complete documentation for all namespaces is in the source and API
docs: http://clojure.github.com/clojure/


== 3.1 clojure.java.io ==

Java I/O libraries distilled from the duck-streams and io namespaces
in clojure-contrib.


== 3.2 clojure.java.javadoc ==

Launch a Javadoc browser from the REPL, promoted from the javadoc and
repl-util namespace in clojure-contrib.


== 3.3 clojure.java.shell ==

Utilities for launching a subprocess, promoted from shell-out
namespace in clojure-contrib.


== 3.4 clojure.pprint ==

Pretty-printer for Clojure, promoted from pprint in clojure-contrib.


== 3.5 clojure.repl ==

Utilities for a more pleasant REPL experience, promoted from the
repl-utils and ns-utils namespaces in clojure-contrib.


== 3.6 clojure.string ==

String utilities promoted from the str-utils, str-utils2, str-utils3,
and string namespaces in clojure-contrib.
