= 1 Deprecated Features =

== 1.1 add-classpath ==

This function can not be made to work in many environments.   
Always use Java's built-in mechanisms to control the 
classpath.

== 1.2 ^ reader macro ==

The ^ reader macro has been deprecated as a shortcut for meta
in the hopes that it can eventually replace the #^ reader macro.

== 1.3 clojure.parallel ==

The clojure.parallel namespace has been deprecated. Eventually it
will be replaced with a faster and more idiomatic alternative
based on the JDK7 ForkJoin library. A preview of this work is
already available in the 'par' branch of Clojure.


= 2 New Features in clojure.core =

== 2.1 Primitive Array Generators ==


(just like int-array, double-array)

  * boolean-array : New
  * byte-array : New
  * char-array : New
  * short-array : New


== 2.2 Casting To Primitive Arrays ==


(just like ints, doubles)

  * booleans : New
  * bytes : New
  * chars : New
  * shorts : New


== 2.3 Chunked Seqs ==


Some Clojure data structures now yield chunked seqs, which, in addition
to satisfying the normal item-at-a-time seq interface, also support processing  
data sequentially by small blocks called 'chunks'. This can provide greater  
efficiency by leveraging the structure of the data and amortizing the overhead  
of sequential access. Some of the sequence processing functions (like map and filter)  
are now chunk-aware and leverage this efficiency. 

Consumption of chunked-seqs as normal seqs should be completely transparent. However,  
note that some sequence processing will occur up to 32 elements at a time. This could  
matter to you if you are relying on full laziness to preclude the generation of any  
non-consumed results. An interface to force single-item consumption of chunked seqs is  
still being designed. Please share any use cases where chunked processing has resulted  
in behavioral differences that matter to you on the Clojure google group. 

The following fns should be considered implementation details subject to change,  
but can be used for experimentation with building your own chunked-seq  
functions from scratch. See map and filter as examples.

  * chunk : New
  * chunk-buffer : New
  * chunk-append : New
  * chunk-first : New
  * chunk-rest : New
  * chunk-next : New
  * chunk-cons : New
  * chunked-seq? : New


== 2.4 Futures ==


Futures represent asynchronous computations. They are away to get  
code to run in another thread, and obtain the result. 

  * future : New
  * future? : New
  * future-done? : New
  * future-cancel : New
  * future-cancelled? : New 


== 2.5 Promises ==


A promise is a synchronization construct that can be used to deliver a value  
from one thread to another. Until the value has been delivered, any attempt  
to dereference the promise will block. It thus enables dataflow-style programming. 

  * promise : New
  * deliver : New



== 2.6 Futures vs. Promises ==


A future is associated with a computation, whereas a promise is just a handoff reference. 


== 2.7 Transients ==

See: http://clojure.org/transients

  * transient : New
  * persistent! : New
  * conj! : New
  * assoc! : New
  * dissoc! : New
  * pop! : New
  * disj! : New


== 2.8 User-Controlled Thread Bindings ==

  * push-thread-bindings : New
  * pop-thread-bindings : New
  * get-thread-bindings : New
  * with-bindings* : New
  * with-bindings : New
  * bound-fn* : New
  * bound-fn : New


== 2.9 Ref History ==

  * ref : Updated
  * ref-history-count : New
  * ref-min-history : New
  * ref-max-history : New


== 2.10 Function pre- and postconditions ==

  Functions support specifying runtime pre- and postconditions.
  See: http://clojure.org/special_forms


== 2.11 Miscellaneous ==

  * juxt : New
  * import : Now a macro form
  * assert : Now with *assert* binding
  * slurp : Now with encoding parameter
  * with-loading-context : New

= 3 New Namespaces =

Complete documentation for all namespaces is in the source and API docs.

== 3.1 clojure.test ==

The test framework formerly known as clojure.contrib.test-is.


== 3.2 clojure.test.junit ==

An extension to clojure.test for JUnit-style XML output.  This
enables you to use JUnit reporting tools with clojure.test.


== 3.3 clojure.stacktrace ==

A few utility functions for printing Java stacktraces in a
format that distinguishes between Clojure function calls
and Java method calls.


== 3.4 clojure.walk ==

A simple tree walker for transforming data structures.  Similar in
intent to clojure.zip, but less flexible.  Useful when you want to
call a function on every value in a complex, nested data structure.

Includes some examples such as stringify-keys, which replaces all
keywords in a map with strings, and macroexpand-all, a
quick-and-dirty macroexpansion tester.  Note: macroexpand-all is
NOT 100% correct, it just recursively tries to macroexpand a form;
it does not correctly interpret special forms such as let.


== 3.5 clojure.template ==

Macros that apply a "template expression" to a list of forms.
Used to implement the "are" macro in clojure.test.
