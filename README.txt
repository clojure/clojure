= Building Clojure-contrib =

If you downloaded a release distribution or pre-compiled JAR, you
do NOT need to build anything.

If you downloaded the sources from Github, you will need Apache Maven
(2.0 or higher) to run the build.  See http://maven.apache.org/

AFTER version 1.2.0, clojure-contrib is divided into many small modules.

To build all the modules, run the following command in this directory:

    mvn install

This will compile and test all modules and store them in your local
Maven repository cache (usually $HOME/.m2/repository).

There is also an "uberjar" containing all compiled modules at
./modules/complete/target/complete-$VERSION-bin.jar

Additional build commands are available:

    mvn clojure:repl
    To start a Clojure REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop)

    mvn compile
    To compile sources without building a JAR

    mvn test
    To run unit tests

    mvn assembly:assembly
    To build ZIP/tar distributions containing source and JARs

To skip the testing phase when building, add "-Dmaven.test.skip=true"
to the mvn command line.



= Building Against Specific Released Clojure Versions =

You can specify -Dclojure.version=VERSION on the command line to select a different Clojure version.



= Building Against a Custom Clojure JAR =

To build against a customized Clojure JAR, you can specify
-Dclojure.jar=/absolute/path/to/clojure.jar on the command line.



= Clojure-contrib Versions =

Versions of clojure-contrib are matched to versions of Clojure.

If you are using Clojure 1.0, use clojure-contrib 1.0.*

If you are using Clojure 1.1, use clojure-contrib 1.1.*

If you are using Clojure 1.2, use clojure-contrib 1.2.*

If you are using Clojure 1.3, use clojure-contrib 1.3.*

If you are using Clojure from the "master" branch on Github, use
clojure-contrib from the "master" branch on Github.
