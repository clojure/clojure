# clj-env-dir Launches Clojure, passing along command line arguments. This
#             launcher can be configured using environment variables and
#             makes it easy to include directories full of classpath roots
#             in CLASSPATH.

# Created 7 January 2009
#
# Environment variables (optional):
#
#  CLOJURE_EXT  Colon-delimited list of paths to directories whose top-level
#               contents are (either directly or as symbolic links) jar
#               files and/or directories whose paths will be in Clojure's
#               classpath. The value of the CLASSPATH environment variable
#               for Clojure will include these top-level paths followed by
#               the previous value of CLASSPATH (if any).
#               default:
#               example: /usr/local/share/clojure/ext:$HOME/.clojure.d/ext
#
#  CLOJURE_JAVA The command to launch a JVM instance for Clojure
#               default: java
#               example: /usr/local/bin/java6
#
#  CLOJURE_OPTS Java options for this JVM instance
#               default:
#               example:"-Xms32M -Xmx128M -server"
#
#  CLOJURE_MAIN The Java class to launch
#               default: clojure.main
#               example: clojure.contrib.repl_ln
